# go-learning
A set of projects used to help during my learning of Go.

Excuse the terrible code.. if it is terrible, I don't know just yet!

(I couldn't find a Gopher emoji)

### Projects
1. Add up numbers - Takes any integers given in flags and then return the sum.
2. Directory Tree - Outputs the current working directory and any sub directories and files in a nice tree format
3. Reddit JSON - Parse the contents of a given subreddit (/r/floof as default)
